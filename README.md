University Admit Eligibility Predictor

There are a lot of students wondering and anxious whether they will get the University they want. There are some circumstances where the 
student does not get the  University they want. This can be avoided by using this web application. The students can check whether they
are eligible to get their desired University using this web application. This proposed system uses Machine Learning algorithms
to predict whether the particular student gets the university he/she desires based on the GRE Score, TOEFL/IELTS Score, CGPA and Research or not. When
this system is used, Students can get a clear idea on which university they can try and succeed in getting into it.

Reviewing is a great way to know whether our system works fine based on the reviews that are given by the user. Once the outcome is predicted and shown on the
screen, the student can give their review for this model. There will also be an option to give a review after the student gets into the University. This helps in improving
the model more.
